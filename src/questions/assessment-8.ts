// In the app folder there is a search route that fetches users from the GitHub API.
// The page is client-side rendered and the data is fetched on the client.
// Rewrite the code to use server-side rendering and try to send as little javascript code to the client.
// Furthermore, the organization of the code (folder structure) is rather messy and
// the code is tightly coupled. Restructure the code to make it more modular,
// reusable and maintainable. Feel free to over-engineer it :D
// Don't worry about the styling, it's not about how pretty the page looks, but about
// how pretty the code is.
// You can run the code with `npm run dev` and navigate to http://localhost:3000/search
